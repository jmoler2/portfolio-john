Presenting Honk!: A new take on travel-centric social media. Honk! is an all-in-one travel/social media site. Plan trips with your friends or scope out a new vacation with your friends, from the comfort of your laptop or phone. Honk! is a forum-based travel platform that allows people to freely post and discuss different travel destinations, from restaurants to resorts and everything in between. Use our explore function to find exciting and trendy new destinations, or simply talk with locals and travellers about your favorite places to visit. 

Honk! also allows users to create "travel groups" with their friends, in order to plan vacations, nights out, dates, and more!. With customizable privacy, these groups can be used to either create and coordinate large events, go out with a group of friends, or plan a date with someone you met. This new feature allows groups to improve their travel plans, providing open access to a platform to browse and discuss destination options.

By focusing on all-in-one functionality and user accessibility, Honk! makes trip and vacation planning easier than ever. Plan your own adventure with Honk!
