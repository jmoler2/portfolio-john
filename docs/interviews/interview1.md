# Hunch

My hunch is that I will find many issues with the management of platforms that can be fixed. Especially with today's climate, there should be lots of complaints that need to be addressed.

# Beginning Thoughts

As a person who doesn't use social media except for direct messaging, I want to really delve into what social media looks like for people who actively use in their everyday lives. For this reason, I am going to be targeting two different demographics based on generation, with the constant being that they use social media more than the average person. Specifically, I want to find people who would be "dedicated users" of my social media app that I am developing. 

# First Interviewee: High Schooler

The first person I selected to interview is a high school student that a friend of mine connected me with who is active on social media. I wanted an interviewee who had at least two thousand followers or some equivalent level of following on their respective social media.

# Second Interviewee: Security Worker

My second interviewee was chosen based on the same criteria but a different generation. This allows me to target the opinions of avid social media users without getting homogenous opinions. In particular, I also wanted this person to use a different kind of social media than the high schooler.

# Questions: 

Tell me a little bit about yourself.

What social media platforms do you use?

How much time do you spend on social media every day?

(From here on out, prompt anything that might lead to a story)

Tell me about what makes you want to use social media when you do. (leads into asking about the deeper meanings behind what they use social media for)

Is there anything that gets in your way of achieving your goals on social media? (note: maybe find a better way to word this. I want to find anything that I might be able to improve.)

How does social media help with your connections to people? Is there anything that aggravates you about other people's activity on social media?

What do you think of (company) behind (platform)? (personalize based on whatever they use and whats going on with that platformn)

Prompt for any stories that aggravate them here.

The rest of the interview will be reserved for addressing any answers I am curious about or that I think I could draw a story out of.
