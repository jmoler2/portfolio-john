For privacy purposes, interviewees will be referred to as interviewee 1 or interviewee 2, respectively. In their own sections, they will just be referred to as interviewee.

# Interview 1 Writeup

Interviewee is high school age, active on social media with around 3.5k followers on Instagram and 1k on TikTok. 

The first part of my interview focused mainly on the why of social media for this demographic. I discovered that this person (as well as found others after the interview) did not necessarily use social media to stay connected with their friends, and instead used it as a means of content creation (along the lines of story telling or entertainment), which I found surprising, as it seems to be a shift from when I used social media in high school. When prompted for what made Instagram and Tiktok the best platforms for content, the interviewee responded positively regarding the accessibility of the platforms' content creation system, as well as the ease of reaching wide audiences.

Next I focused on the "how" of social media for them. The first big issue (which was unsurprising to me, but notable enough that I need to mention it) was privacy. The interviewee expressed a lot of discomfort with how little they believed their privacy was being respected with respect to the companies managing the social media platforms. This, while unsurprising, should serve as a guide for me as I am developing my own app in order to keep me from falling in the same hole. The interviewee responded fondly when asked about how they enjoy the platform's ability to deliver content, and expressed that these platforms in particular stand out because of how absorbed you can become while using them. Upon further questioning, I found that it wasn't just the content recommendation algorithm (which is what I expected), but that the UI employed by these platforms plays a big role for this person in keeping them absorbed. Interviewer said that the UI "allows them to absorb themselves and just destress and relax after a long day".

# Interview 2 Writeup

Interviewee is a ~30 year old male who works in security at one of the dorms. He uses Instagram lightly and Reddit/Twitter more heavily.

This interview also started exploring why they used social media. Reasons given were "connections with friends", "keeping up with national news", and "keeping up with local news". In particular, examples were given relating to politics, public safety, and interpersonal relationships. The interviewee in this case seemed to be much more personally connected with their social media usage than the first interviewee, and seemed to be more dependent on it for interactions with the world around them. Interviewer even stated that "social media might be the only news source I have followed for this election whatsoever".

Next, I moved onto the "how" again, and here found a lot of issues that did not really surface during my other interview. Interviewee described Reddit and other platforms as "negligent" and "evil" in response to me probing about their opinion on recent controversy on both Reddit and Twitter. This part of the interview sort of sprialed in terms of contradictions, where the interviewee both demanded "more intense moderation", but also seemed to be against most attempts at overreach by any kind of central moderating team. 


# Bullet Points

1. Community-Led Moderation: This came up in my second interview but there seems to be a lot of unhappiness with moderation on all social media platforms right now. I can think of a few ways of addressing this, but I think it would be cool to have individual communities that could determine the moderation methods within themselves, and avoid having a more central moderation effort. After having done more research, this sentiment seems to be shared by way more people than just the person I interviewed, so it seems like a problem ripe for solving.

2. More Engagable Discussion Forum: My first interviewee expressed that one of the reasons they loved social media so much was because of how easy it is to get absorbed in them. After thinking about this, I found that there really isn't a text-based social media platform that people would consider "approachable". Reddit, Twitter, Threads, and 4chan all seem to be used in a more intense way, and I wonder if there is a market for something more approachable.

3. Interpersonal Content Creation: Content creation has generally seemed to be more detached from just friend-to-friend relationships recently. I find that from both mine and my first interviewee's experience, most content that is accessible on the internet now is made by people who have very large followings and are not well connected with their audience. I believe there is a hole to fill here, especially with examples like Vine showing that small scale content creation was something that did work in the past. 

4. More Personal Text Based Platform: There is a wide gap right now between photo/video "scroll" style social media and more detached forum style platforms. There may be a way to tie them together to reach a wider user base. In my interviews, both used their own respective platforms and didn't really care much about the other one.
