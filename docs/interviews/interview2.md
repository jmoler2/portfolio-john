For privacy purposes, interviewees will be referred to as interviewee 1 or interviewee 2, respectively. In their own sections, they will just be referred to as interviewee.

# Interview 1 Writeup

Interviewee is high school age, active on social media with around 3.5k followers on Instagram and 1k on TikTok. 

The first part of my interview focused mainly on the why of social media for this demographic. I discovered that this person (as well as found others after the interview) did not necessarily use social media to stay connected with their friends, and instead used it as a means of content creation (along the lines of story telling or entertainment), which I found surprising, as it seems to be a shift from when I used social media in high school. When prompted for what made Instagram and Tiktok the best platforms for content, the interviewee responded positively regarding the accessibility of the platforms' content creation system, as well as the ease of reaching wide audiences.

Next I focused on the "how" of social media for them. The first big issue (which was unsurprising to me, but notable enough that I need to mention it) was privacy. The interviewee expressed a lot of discomfort with how little they believed their privacy was being respected with respect to the companies managing the social media platforms. This, while unsurprising, should serve as a guide for me as I am developing my own app in order to keep me from falling in the same hole. The interviewee responded fondly when asked about how they enjoy the platform's ability to deliver content, and expressed that these platforms in particular stand out because of how absorbed you can become while using them. Upon further questioning, I found that it wasn't just the content recommendation algorithm (which is what I expected), but that the UI employed by these platforms plays a big role for this person in keeping them absorbed. Interviewer said that the UI "allows them to absorb themselves and just destress and relax after a long day".

# Interview 2 Writeup

Interviewee is a ~30 year old male who works in security at one of the dorms. He uses Instagram lightly and Reddit/Twitter more heavily.

This interview also started exploring why they used social media. Reasons given were "connections with friends", "keeping up with national news", and "keeping up with local news". In particular, examples were given relating to politics, public safety, and interpersonal relationships. The interviewee in this case seemed to be much more personally connected with their social media usage than the first interviewee, and seemed to be more dependent on it for interactions with the world around them. Interviewer even stated that "social media might be the only news source I have followed for this election whatsoever".

Next, I moved onto the "how" again, and here found a lot of issues that did not really surface during my other interview. Interviewee described Reddit and other platforms as "negligent" and "evil" in response to me probing about their opinion on recent controversy on both Reddit and Twitter. This part of the interview sort of sprialed in terms of contradictions, where the interviewee both demanded "more intense moderation", but also seemed to be against most attempts at overreach by any kind of central moderating team. 


# Bullet Points

1. Community-Led Moderation: This came up in my second interview but there seems to be a lot of unhappiness with moderation on all social media platforms right now. I can think of a few ways of addressing this, but I think it would be cool to have individual communities that could determine the moderation methods within themselves, and avoid having a more central moderation effort. After having done more research, this sentiment seems to be shared by way more people than just the person I interviewed, so it seems like a problem ripe for solving.

2. More Engagable Discussion Forum: My first interviewee expressed that one of the reasons they loved social media so much was because of how easy it is to get absorbed in them. After thinking about this, I found that there really isn't a text-based social media platform that people would consider "approachable". Reddit, Twitter, Threads, and 4chan all seem to be used in a more intense way, and I wonder if there is a market for something more approachable.

3. Interpersonal Content Creation: Content creation has generally seemed to be more detached from just friend-to-friend relationships recently. I find that from both mine and my first interviewee's experience, most content that is accessible on the internet now is made by people who have very large followings and are not well connected with their audience. I believe there is a hole to fill here, especially with examples like Vine showing that small scale content creation was something that did work in the past. 

4. More Personal Text Based Platform: There is a wide gap right now between photo/video "scroll" style social media and more detached forum style platforms. There may be a way to tie them together to reach a wider user base. In my interviews, both used their own respective platforms and didn't really care much about the other one. 





# Interview 1: High School Social Media User


Tell me a little bit about yourself.

11th grade. Chronically online. Likes to dance. Woodworking?


What social media platforms do you use?

Mostly Instagram and TikTok. Uses Twitter sometimes but not actively

How much time do you spend on social media every day?

4-8 hours a day during the summer. Did not have an accurate time for the school year. Ranges from 1 hour to 10 hours.

(From here on out, prompt anything that might lead to a story)

Tell me about what makes you want to use social media when you do. (leads into asking about the deeper meanings behind what they use social media for)

Likes to make entertaining content for people. Talked about some videos that they made. described as "popularity contest". It remains unclear if that is good or bad and when asked, could not say whether it was good or bad either. Could be both. Good for engagement though. In particular, interviewee seems to like showing off talents on social media, which is cool.

Is there anything that gets in your way of achieving your goals on social media? (note: maybe find a better way to word this. I want to find anything that I might be able to improve.)

Hard for small creators to reach anybody. Content recommendation algorithms tend to favor giant creators even when people are already following you or engaged with you. This may be something to address in my ideas, as it could draw in a lot of attention from small artists, businesses, and talents if I make marketing and accessibility a priority.

How does social media help with your connections to people? Is there anything that aggravates you about other people's activity on social media?

Did not get much out of the connections question. This interviewee seems fairly detached from having interpersonal relationships over social media. Talked about seeing their friends on social media and how they cooperated to make videos, etc., but not as much interpersonal connection as I expected. They did complain about a lot of behavior on social media that I did not find particularly compelling, but they were passionate about it. 

What do you think of (company) behind (platform)? (personalize based on whatever they use and whats going on with that platformn)

Asked about particularly TikTok and Meta administration. They expressed small concerns about privacy and then repeated concerns that their videos could not reach people again.

Prompt for any stories that aggravate them here.

Got told a lot of stories that reflect well on the engagability of these platforms. Perhaps it should be a design focus of mine to make it easy to absorb yourself in my platform. Would drive up user engagement by a large amount.


# Interview 2: 30 Year Old Social Media User (Security Worker)

Tell me a little bit about yourself.

31 years old. Male. Works a 8-4:30 job. Grew up locally.


What social media platforms do you use?

Mostly Reddit and Sometimes Instagram and Twitter
When prompted why they use those platforms, was told that the active engagement with other people was a meaningful aspect of why those were chosen


How much time do you spend on social media every day?

4-7 hours a day. This was higher than I thought.

(From here on out, prompt anything that might lead to a story)

Tell me about what makes you want to use social media when you do. (leads into asking about the deeper meanings behind what they use social media for)

Repeat of earlier. Was told that the active connection with other people was important to them, because it helped establish and maintain connections. In particular, they pointed out that it was the only think still keeping them close with a lot of their friends from when they were younger. They also mentioned enjoying debating people online, and actively engaging in discussions, which seemed typical of a Reddit style platform.

Is there anything that gets in your way of achieving your goals on social media? (note: maybe find a better way to word this. I want to find anything that I might be able to improve.)

I could not get a meaningful answer out of this question, despite some rewording and prodding. It seems like the freedom of access to the forum style platforms makes it less difficult to engage with an audience. This could be useul.


How does social media help with your connections to people? Is there anything that aggravates you about other people's activity on social media?

This was a long question. They shared how social media was one of the only ways they kept up with a lot of people in their lives. They shared how it was how they learned who was married, what was happening where they grew up, etc. I pressed this a little bit further and they seem to get most of their information about the outside world from their interactions on social media, including national news, local news, and interpersonal news. This seems important to emphasize because it looks like a large draw to them.

What do you think of (company) behind (platform)? (personalize based on whatever they use and whats going on with that platform)

I asked about Reddit and Twitter. Got a lot of really angry responses  (understandbaly) about the administration behind these platforms and how they were ruining the platform by either adding paywalls, helicoptering their communities, or not helicoptering their communities enough. Lots of contradictions. This seems to be a problem that requires deeper ocnsideration on how the platforms engage with their user base through moderation and just normal interaction.

Prompt for any stories that aggravate them here.

The interview was already long so it ended here.
