# Naming and Audience

The name I am going to give my social media pp is "Honk!!" This is inspired by the geese who were harassing me while I was thinking about the name for this project. The goal of this platform will be to create a more approachable forum based social media platform, based on the sense that our current ones (4chan, reddit, etc) tend to come off as intimidating to new social media users. We want to capitalize on that in order to convert that audience into our userbase. Our platform will provide a friendly environment where you can interact with your own communities, without the abrasiveness and complexity of some of the modern platforms.
