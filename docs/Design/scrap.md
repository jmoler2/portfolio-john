# Scrapbook

Reddit Home Page

I want something that is smooth and approachable like this. However, I think Reddit makes it tough to get involved in communities by shoving popular and common communities on the side. It would be better to make "community discovery" more of a focus on Honk!! and put more effort into it.

Instagram Reels

I want my homepage to have scrollability similar to Instagram reels. This format should drive individual engagement and would be interesting to implement in a forum format where the individual posts can become quite long. I also need to find a way to make this seemless evben though there will presumably be a lot of text, making this style of minimalism impossible.

Tumblr Blog Customization

This is the level of customization I'd like for the profiles on my platform. However, to edit Tumblr blogs like this, you need to have an adept understanding of HTML and I do not want to require my users to understand anything other than my UI in order to customize their profiles.
